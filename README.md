Scripts for analyzing images, sorting, and knockdown of GapPal fusion proteins for _in vivo_ subcellular targeting

Epifluorescence Image Analysis:
cpn_distribution_DET.ijm quantifies fluorescent intensities across callosal projection neurons in red and green channels
gapPal_distribution_analysis.R analyzes fluorescent intensities across callosal projection neurons in red and green channels

Confocal Image Analysis:
gapPal_confocal_analysis.R analyzes fluorescent intensities in callosal projection neuron somata and growth cones in the green channel

Sorting Analysis:
gapPal_sorting_analysis.R analyzes fluorescent intensities of callosal projection neuron somata and growth cones that are purified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescent small particle sorting, respectively

Knockdown Analysis:
gapPal_qPCR_analysis.R analyzes _in vitro_ knockdown efficiencies, as quantified by qPCR
